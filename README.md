[Everything you need to know about Voronoi Diagrams: Analyze Service Areas of Transit Stations in Tokyo](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/data-snack-use-voronoi-to-analyze-service-areas-of-transit-stations-in-tokyo-b1179b9dc2a3)

## Introduction
Voronoi diagrams are powerful tools in data analysis, offering insights into spatial relationships and distributions. This repository includes a KNIME workflow for calculating service areas of train stations in Tokyo and analyzing restaurant density. By leveraging Voronoi diagrams, we can identify key insights, such as Ueno-okachimachi station having the highest restaurant density in Tokyo Prefecture.

## Installation
To get started with the KNIME workflow, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/martinjurran/KNIME-Tokyo-StationServiceAreas.git
cd KNIME-Tokyo-RestaurantDensity

```

3. Install KNIME:
Download and install KNIME from the official website.
Open the workflow:
4. Launch KNIME.
Open the voronoi_diagrams.knwf file from the cloned repository.
5. Open the workflow:
Follow the instructions within the KNIME interface.
6. Connect data sources:
Connect the data sources within KNIME. They need to be connected within the Geofile Reader nodes.
 5. Execute the workflow:
Execute the workflow and analyze the data.
